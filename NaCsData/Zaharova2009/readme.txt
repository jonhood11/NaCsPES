Table I
In table I a comparision of experimental termvalues of the A - b complex 
in NaCs with calculated ones is given. In addition the fractional states 
partition of the non - adiabatic wavefunctions is presented 
Table II
The resulting Extended Morse Oscillator (EMO) parameters of 
the deperturbed (diabatic) potential energy curves of the 
singlet A1Sigma+ state and triplet b3Pi_(Omega=0) sub-state.
Table III
The resulting EMO parameters of spin-orbit coupling functions.
Table IV 

The resulting deperturbed (diabatic) potential energy curves of the singlet 
A1Sigma+ state U_A(r) and triplet b3Pi(Omega=0,1,2) sub-states 
U_b0(r), U_b1(r), U_b2(r) as well as spin-orbit splitting A_01(r), A_12(r) 
and V_Ab0(r) functions.
Energies - in cm-1, internuclear distance in Angstroms.
